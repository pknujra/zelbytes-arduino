# Hardware Description 
- Board type : Arduino Uno R3
- Com : 8
- The Arduino Uno R3 is a widely used open-source microcontroller development board based on the ATmega328P microcontroller. It provides an easy-to-use platform for designing and prototyping electronic projects, making it popular among students, hobbyists, and professionals. The board features 14 digital input/output pins, 6 analog input pins, a USB interface for programming and communication, and operates at a clock speed of 16 MHz. Its compatibility with a wide range of sensors, actuators, and modules makes it suitable for applications such as robotics, automation, IoT systems, and embedded system development.

- 2-Channel 5V Relay Module (Songle SRD-05VDC-SL-C): A dual-channel relay module used to control high-voltage or high-current loads from a microcontroller. The module operates on a 5V control signal and provides two independent relay channels with NO, NC, and COM terminals for switching external devices. It includes onboard driver circuitry and status LEDs for reliable interfacing with Arduino-based systems.

Power Connections

- External Power Supply Positive → 12V Terminal
- External Power Supply Ground → GND Terminal
- Arduino GND → L298N GND

Motor Connections

- Motor Terminal 1 → OUT1
- Motor Terminal 2 → OUT2

Control Connections

- ENA → Arduino D9
- IN1 → Arduino D10
- IN2 → Arduino D11

The button is configured using INPUT_PULLUP mode.

Working Principle

The Arduino generates PWM signals on pin D9 to control motor speed through the L298N motor driver. Pins D10 and D11 determine motor direction. The relay module controls the valve operation. The emergency stop push button uses an external interrupt on pin D2 to instantly stop the motor and close the valve when activated.

Safety Notes

- Common ground must be connected between Arduino and L298N.
- Never connect the motor directly to Arduino pins.
- Verify motor voltage before applying power.
- Test emergency stop operation before normal use.
